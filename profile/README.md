## 🧠 Our Philosophy

> **Clean Code • Simplicity • Performance • Reliability**

We believe great software should feel effortless — to use, to understand, and to maintain.  
That’s why our philosophy centers around four principles:

1. **Elegance Over Complexity**  
   Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.  
2. **Automation Everywhere**  
   If a human has to repeat it twice, a machine should handle it next time.  
3. **Community First**  
   We build tools for developers, by developers.  
4. **Long-Term Thinking**  
   We don’t cut corners. We design for the next five years, not the next sprint.
